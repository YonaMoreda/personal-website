            <h1>Hi,</h1>
            <p>
                I am Yona Moreda. An aspiring software engineer from Ethiopia. I graduated from the American
                International School of Dhaka with international baccalaureate diploma (2015-17).
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, I pursued my Bachelor degree at University of Groningen in Computing Science from 2017 to 2020.
                I have attained my degree within 3 years, with a final cumulative GPA of 8.1.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about developing software for desktop or mobile applications. I also find it interesting
                to work with web applications and have project experience with both back end and front end web
                frameworks (discussed below).
            </p>
        </div>
